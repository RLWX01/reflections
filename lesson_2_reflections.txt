What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
--> creates necesary (hidden) skelton or folders and files.  That is how Git works.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?
--> WD is where one makes changes; SA is where Git copies those files before a 'commit'; Repo is where Git records changes in those files

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?
--> grouping all related changed files

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history
organized? How would branches help?
--> experimental changes which do not affect fully-working system until a merge is done.

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?
--> more easily understand commits and branches and know where to make changes and possibly where (and how) to merge

What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in
the diagram the way we do?
--> chnages in second added to first to creat combined head; lineage is shown well in diag form.

What are the pros and cons of Gitâ€™s automatic merging vs. always doing merges
manually?
