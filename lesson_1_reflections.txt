How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    --> makes it much quicker and easier to pin-point varienses

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    --> spot changes that may have caused a bug at a moment in time.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    --> allows a more logical relation between the versions and the commit's comment

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    --> code often needs to balance changes between files; most files in GD do not have this req

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    --> log at high-level and diff at low-level

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    --> can always go back and find causes or breakage

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    --> code management
